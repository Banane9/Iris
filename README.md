Iris

When looking for a IRC Client for Windows Phone 8, I found that, whenever you lock the phone, all sockets (ie. IRC Connections) are dropped.

So I thought, why not make a Bouncer that allows the client to tell it from when it wants the messages.

Push notifications for how many messages you missed since your last login would be nice too.

So this Project aims to accomplish that, as well as provide extensibility through plugins.
